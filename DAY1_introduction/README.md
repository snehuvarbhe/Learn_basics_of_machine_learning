# Introduction to Machine learning
Greetings everyone! Here's the opening for our machine learning introduction. Inside this repository, you'll discover a wealth of study materials tailored for those passionate about delving into the world of machine learning.

# What is machine learning?
In easy language we can say that machine learning is essentially the process of acquiring knowledge from data.

In conventional programming, we write a program that takes input data and generates output data. However, in machine learning, we furnish both input data and corresponding output data to the machine, and it autonomously generates a program or model.

1. AI (Artificial Intelligence): The broader concept of machines or systems mimicking human intelligence to perform tasks.

2. ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI where systems learn from data to improve performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.

3. DL (Deep Learning): A subfield of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to automatically learn and represent data.
